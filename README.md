# GraphQL Authentication

A GraphQL authentication starter project to built on.

## Setup

Note: mLab may redirect you to mongoDB Atlas. The steps to setup are still the same.

1. Get a [mLab](https://mlab.com/) account
2. Create a new mLab cluster
3. Add a database user
4. Copy and paste the connection string to the MONGO_URI variable in server/server.js
5. Replace `<password>` with the password you created
6. Execute `npm run dev`
